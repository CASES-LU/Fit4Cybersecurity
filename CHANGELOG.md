Fit4Cybersecurity Changelog
===========================

## 0.0.2 (not yet released)

### Improvements

- when nothing is clicked, the "Next" button should be gray (to show that you
  can't continue) [#1](https://github.com/CASES-LU/Fit4Cybersecurity/issues/1);
- when you have started the survey, and you click on the logo, the survey just
  ends without any warning or time to take the user ID. There should be at least
  a warning when clicking on the logo, or even the "Continue later" menu
  [#1](https://github.com/CASES-LU/Fit4Cybersecurity/issues/1).

### Fixes

- the Diagnostic contact form does not appear if you have more than 80 as a
  result [#1](https://github.com/CASES-LU/Fit4Cybersecurity/issues/1).


## 0.0.1 (2019-10-22)

- first public release of Fit4Cybersecurity.
