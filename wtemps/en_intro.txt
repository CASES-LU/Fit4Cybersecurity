Introduction and Warning

The objective of the self-assessment tool, Fit4Cybersecurity, is to assess the maturity of an organisation in terms of applicable good practices in the field of information security.

This document, based on the Fit4Cybersecurity, is for the exclusive use of the customer and respects confidentiality.

Taking into account that this methodology is relying on your self-evaluation, you must understand that the overall results can not in any way be exhaustive. Thus, the actual risk assessment or list of identified risks and vulnerabilities is based on information provided by the Customer. The analysis resulting from this assessment can engage only the customer for any omission or error that would be due to third parties or not.

The tool, Fit4Cybersecurity can provide recommendations sets. Those recommendations are neither exclusive nor exhaustive.

It should also be noted that the information you have provided will be recorded for statistical reasons, but because of the nature of the data, we can not identify you. If you contact us to do a CASES diagnostics, we will be able to link your company to your results. Until then, you can not be identified.
